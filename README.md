Discord-EZ is my fourth attemption at a Discord bot. This time, I'm using a more general JS coding style, instead of my previous attempts. 

## Current commands:

### ping

Replies with "Pong!"

### kauser [username/kaid]

Gives information about a KA user

### kapogram [id]

Gives information about a KA program

### define [word]

Provides a defintions list for the word

### pronounce [word]

Links a video of how to pronounce the word

### translate [language]* [word(s)]

## Invite

This bot is still in development, so it is not recommended to implement it into any servers :)
